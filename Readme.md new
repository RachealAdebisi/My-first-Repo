# My First Repository

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Racheal Adebisi, and I am currently learning tech to start my journey as a developer.

This repository contains my **first HTML file: Hello World!** as I practice using GitHub to build my coding presence.

## What I've Learned So Far

- How to create a GitHub account
- How to create a repository
- How to upload files to GitHub

## Next Steps

- Learn HTML and CSS
- Build small projects
- Document my learning here

 This is just the beginning of my journey, and I am excited to keep learning and growing.
